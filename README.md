<b>CS-340: Client/Server Development</b>

Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is all about using clear structure, meaningful naming conventions, modular design, and thorough documentation. When I worked on the CRUD Python module in Project One, I kept these principles in mind. By creating separate functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records, I made the code easy to understand and reuse. This modular approach made it much easier to connect the CRUD module to the dashboard widgets in Project Two. Since the CRUD module handled all the database operations, the dashboard only needed to call those functions instead of managing database logic directly. This separation of concerns improved maintainability—if the database structure ever changes, I can update the CRUD module without touching the rest of the application.

The advantage of working this way was that it made the system scalable and flexible. I could add new dashboard features or modify existing ones without rewriting core database logic. In the future, I could reuse the same CRUD module for other projects that need database interactions—such as a web app or another analytics dashboard—by simply adjusting the database connection parameters.

When I approach a problem as a computer scientist, I start by analyzing the client’s needs and breaking the problem down into smaller, manageable parts. For example, with Grazioso Salvare, I examined the database and dashboard requirements carefully before designing the structure. I made sure to understand what data needed to be stored, how it would be accessed, and what insights the dashboard should provide. Compared to previous assignments, this project required more real-world thinking—it wasn’t just about writing code that worked, but designing a system that would be efficient, user-friendly, and easy to maintain. In the future, I’d continue using techniques like normalization, entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs), and modular coding to create effective and scalable databases for clients.

Computer scientists play a critical role in solving problems through technology. Our work matters because we build tools that improve efficiency, accuracy, and decision-making. In the case of Grazioso Salvare, the system I developed helps the company better manage and analyze rescue dog data, which ultimately supports their mission of saving lives. By turning data into actionable insights, computer scientists enable organizations to focus on their goals while relying on technology to streamline operations and improve outcomes.
